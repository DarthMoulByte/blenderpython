## Jump to Cut 6

**[Jump to Cut](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Sequencer/Jump_to_cut)** has been there for a while (in October will fulfill five years!) and it's still running to help you keep important things together when editing video with blender.

Since version 2.73 there is an option to jump to edit points, so Jump to Cut's original feature has been integrated into Blender code !!  =)

<img align="" src="/imgs/jump_to_cut_panel_001.png">

### Main Controls

<img align="" src="/imgs/jumpers.png">

##### Seconds 

Skip through the Timeline by one-second increments. The number of frames to skip is based on render settings for current scene. The script enables two new key bindings:

* shortcut keys **ctrl + shift + left arrow** to skip back one second,
* shortcut keys **ctrl + shift + right arrow** to skip forward one second. 

##### Cuts

The timeline cursor jumps from edit point to edit point. Edit point is any point of entry or departure of a clip, or the cutting start and end. 

* shortcut keys **Q** and **W**   

(it is assigned by default to **PgUp** and **PgDown**)

**This buttons are shortcuts for the new internal operator (added recently in Gooseberry project)**


##### Markers

As you can guess, jump from marker to marker.

* shortcut keys **alt + Q** and **alt + W**  

### VSE fundamentals

<img align="" src="/imgs/maincontrols.png">

This are self explanatory, some useful internal operators...

### Trim Timeline Tools

* TODO: use also preview timeline!!

<img align="" src="/imgs/trimmers.png">

##### In / Out

Set start and end frames of current scene according to In and Out markers.

##### Selection

Set start and end frames of current scene to match selected strips in the Sequence Editor.

It also centers the view into the selection

##### All

Set start and end frames of current scene according to the content of the Sequence Editor.

It also centers the view into the selection

## Extra Tools

Many of the following operators are from the addon **[Extra Sequencer Actions](http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Sequencer/Extra_Sequencer_Actions)** made in 2012 by **[Turi Scandurra](http://www.turiscandurra.com/)**

### Snap and Handles

<img align="" src="/imgs/snap2.png">

<img align="" src="/imgs/snap.png">

##### Snap 

This are self explanatory, otherwise you can test and see what happens...

##### Handle selector

This are self explanatory, otherwise you can test and see what happens...

### Meta Tools

<img align="" src="/imgs/meta_tools2.png">

<img align="" src="/imgs/meta_tools.png">

##### Meta + Copy

This operator makes a metastrip with all selected items, and trim them to in and out.
If there is no IN and OUT markers, the meta is not trimmed.

##### Paste + Snap

Paste the clipboard content starting at the timeline cursor.

##### Un-meta + Trim

The selected meta is ungrouped and all related strips outside in and out range are trimmed.


## IN and OUT Tools

<img align="" src="/imgs/io_tools4.png">

<img align="" src="/imgs/io_tools2.png">

##### set IN / set OUT:

Create a marker IN and a marker OUT where the timeline cursor are. Two specific markers that can then be used for editing.

##### Selected:

Create a marker IN at the selected strip start frame and a marker OUT at the selected strip end frame.

##### Trim:

Trim (soft cut) the selected clip on both sides to adhere to the In and Out markers, as long as the clip is within that range. If not, or in absence of In and Out, does nothing. I.E. It is a quick option to cut many clips at the same duration.

##### Auto Markers

Bli bli bla bla

<img align="" src="/imgs/io_tools3.png">

<img align="" src="/imgs/io_tools.png">
 

If automarkers is selected, each scene stores his owns IN and OUT markers and you can move it only with this tools...

You can access this in and out markers with this:

    bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].kr_in_marker

    bpy.data.scenes['Scene'].kr_out_marker

## Extra Sequencer Actions

<img align="" src="/imgs/extra.png">


<img align="" src="/imgs/extra1.png">

##### Jog/Shuttle

Jog through current sequence, looping between start and end frames. This action is known as jogging, shuttling or scrubbing. Click the operator to enter interactive mode. Move mouse cursor along X axis to jog. To exit, click left or right mouse button or hit ESC.

##### Navigate Up

Move current view to parent timeline. Only enabled when current view is relative to a Meta strip. This operator does not perform any modification to timeline elements.

##### Extend to Fill

Extend active strip forward to fill adjacent space. If there no other strip is following active one on the same channel, the clip is extended to the end of the sequence.

<img align="" src="/imgs/extra2.png">

##### File Place

Place active file from File Browser to Sequencer Editor on current frame.

##### File Insert

Same as above, but also move forward all strips after current frame.

##### Slip

Alter in and out points of a strip but not its duration. Only available when a the type of active strip is Movie, Scene or Meta. Click 'Input...' to choose the amount of sliding desired. The start and end frame of active strip will be moved, but its length and position will remain unchanged.

Interactive mode. Move mouse cursor along X axis to jog. To exit, click left or right mouse button or hit ESC.

**This button is shortcut for the new internal operator (added recently in Gooseberry project)**

<img align="" src="/imgs/extra3.png">

##### Fade

Fade opacity of active strip, or its volume if its type is Sound, creating keyframes for the corresponding property. Possible fade directions are In, Out, In and Out. Duration defines the number of frames between the start and the end of the fade. Amount defines the maximum value that the fade will set. For opacity fades, the maximum value is 1.0. The minimum value reached by the fade is always 0. Keyframes created with this operator can be manipulated through the F-Curve Editor.

##### Copy Properties

Copy properties of active strip to selected strips. Start selecting multiple strips, then make active the strip whose properties need to be copied to the selected strips. Click the desired operator to perform the action. Some operators affect single properties, while some others affect a group of properties.

##### Ripple Delete

Delete the active strip and shift back all other strips the number of frames between the beginning of deleted strip and the next edit in the sequence.

##### Ripple cut

Same as above, but copying active strip to memory buffer before deleting it. Copied strip can be pasted in place as usual, for example using the keystroke combination ctrl-V.

* **TO FIX:** ripple cut and ripple delete: some strips change their channel position
it seems to happend when one involved strips is the one in higher position...

##### insert 

Shift forward all strips after current frame and insert active strip.

* **TO FIX:** insert operator works fine but sometimes some strips change their
channel position.


##### Insert (Single Channel)

Same as above, but shifting occurs only on the same channel as active strip.


### VSE Header Menu > select

<img align="" src="/imgs/menu_select.png">

##### Select All by Type

Select all the strips of the specified type in the Sequence Editor.

##### Current-Frame-Aware Select

Select strips on all channels according to current frame. Available modes are:

* Before (select all strips before current frame),
* After (select all strips after current frame),
* On (select all strips underneath playhead). 

##### Select same channel

Select strips on the same channel as selected


### VSE Header Menu > add

<img align="" src="/imgs/menu_add.png">

##### Create a Movieclip strip

When a movie or image strip is selected, this operator creates a movieclip or find the correspondent movieclip that already exists for this footage, and add a VSE strip with same cuts the original strip has.It can convert movie strips and image sequences, both with hard cuts or soft cuts.

##### File Name to Strip Name

Set strip name to input file name. This operator is useful after separating images of a sequence.

### MovieClip Editor Header Menu > Clip

### Timeline Header Menu > frame

<img align="" src="/imgs/menu_frame.png">

##### Skip One Second

Skip through the Timeline by one-second increments. The number of frames to skip is based on render settings for current scene. The script enables two new key bindings:

* shortcut keys **ctrl + shift + left arrow** to skip back one second,
* shortcut keys **ctrl + shift + right arrow** to skip forward one second. 

##### Trim to Selection

Set start and end frames of current scene to match selected strips in the Sequence Editor.

It also centers the view into the selection

##### Trim to Timeline Content

Set start and end frames of current scene according to the content of the Sequence Editor.

It also centers the view into the selection


## Proxy Tools

<img align="" src="/imgs/proxy_tools.png">


## Audio Tools

<img align="" src="/imgs/audio_tools.png">

### Extract WAV

create a wav file out of a selected movie strip in the indicated path.
If the audio file already exists in the path, it is loaded and trimmed according to the selected movie strip.

You can also generate ffmpeg scripts to launch a batch conversion out of blender.

### Sync Tool

This is useful to sync diferent audio strips to a single movie strip. It does not mantain the sync if you move only the movie strip, but anytime you can delete audio strips and reload again synced.

Select an audio strip and a movie strip and press **set sync** to store sync information in a text file. 

Press **reload audio** with a movie strip selected to reload the audio files

### Audio Meters

<img align="" src="/imgs/audio_tools_meter.png">

To use this you need to install Jack and JACK Meterbridge. Select the meter type and press **Launch audio meter**

<img align="" src="/imgs/audio_tools_metertype.png">

The operator launch the meterbridge app and connect it to pulseaudio jack sink. If it doesn work for your system, try to open Qjackctl and connect manually.

If you install pulseaudio along with jack, **you don't need to compile Blender with jack enabled** to use this feature. 

For now it only works for linux but windows or osx can be implemented (need some testers for this...)

More info about available meters: http://plugin.org.uk/meterbridge/

## Exif info panel

<img align="" src="/imgs/exif.png">

Select a strip and press 'Read EXIF data'. Works only with image and movie strips 

to get exif info panel you need to install exiftools:

    sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl


## Eco Tools    (WARNING!: CPU INTENSIVE:)

<img align="" src="/imgs/eco.png">

TODO: keep metastrip in the same channel

Only visible with a Metastrip selected

Select a movie or meta strip, set number of echoes and offset (in frames), and press Eco button.

The opacity of all strips is updated to 1/number of echoes to mantain luminance. The blending is set to alpha over for all clips except first one.

If add mode is selected, the blending is set to add.

All clips are finally grouped inside a meta. Press home after running the script to see the meta.


## Random Editor panel (EXPERIMENTAL)

Only visible with a Metastrip selected

<img align="" src="/imgs/random_editor.png">

###Random Scratch Operator

Given *IN and OUT* points, a *duration* in frames, and a Meta as *source*, the operator populates the in and out range with random cuts from source, all with the same *duration*

### Random Editor Operator

Not working yet!

## Glitch panel (EXPERIMENTAL)

<img align="" src="/imgs/glitch.png">

for the moment it has only glitch algorithm, you need to install aviglitch
