  - Each light can have different light texture
  - Toggle lights
  - Isolate light
  - Lights are selectable to use render layers
  - 3D Edit operator - interactive light placement and adjustment:
	- Click on object to reposition light in one of two modes: reflection or normal [N].
	- [S] Scale light mesh
	- [G] Grab (meant to be used in rendered preview)
	- [R] Rotate
  - Import/Export of light profiles
