# **Yet Another Vertex Normal Editor (Y.A.V.N.E.)**

This Blender addon provides a set of tools for editing vertex normals. As seen in the following image, Y.A.V.N.E. can dramatically improve the visual quality of a mesh without altering geometry.

### **User Interface** ###

Y.A.V.N.E. is available within the **3D View > Tool Shelf > Shading/UVs** tab for any mesh object in Edit mode.

### **Vertex Normal Weight** ###

Vertex weight types determine how each vertex normal is calculated as the weighted average of adjacent face normals. Y.A.V.N.E. provides several weighting options:

* **Uniform** - Faces normals are averaged evenly.
* **Corner Angle** - Face normals are averaged according to the corner angle of a shared vertex in each face. This is the smooth shading approach used by Blender.
* **Face Area** - Face normals are averaged according to the area of each face.
* **Combined** - Face normals are averaged according to both corner angle and face area.
* **Unweighted** - Face normals are not averaged; vertex normals are static.

Each vertex has exactly one weight type. For quick-and-easy shading, it may be sufficient to assign the **Combined** weight type to all vertices of a mesh. However, thoughtful use of a variety of weight types often yields better results.

### **Face Normal Influence** ###

Face influence types determine which face normals are considered when calculating vertex normals. In the case that a vertex is shared by both **Strong** and **Weak** faces, only the normals of **Strong** faces contribute to the resulting vertex normal.

A typical workflow involves assigning **Weak** influence to transitional portions of a mesh, such as bevels.

### **Get & Set Normals** ###

Basic manual editing of vertex normals is possible with the **Get** and **Set** tools.

**Set** simply assigns the stored normal vector to all selected vertices.

**Get** is a little more involved in that it has multiple modes of operation based on the user's current selection:

* A face normal is stored if exactly one face is selected.
* A vertex normal is stored if exactly one vertex is selected.
  * If the selected vertex has a split normal then the user may interactively select which one to store.

### **Transfer Shading** ###

Interpolated normals can be transferred from a source mesh to the nearest selected vertices of the active, target mesh.

One scenario in which this tool might be useful is when a user wants to add detail to curved sections of a mesh. Cutting faces creates undesirable shading artifacts. By transferring shading from the original mesh, it is possible to correct such imperfections and achieve the desired result.
