# Thread processing for parameters that are invalid to set in a DRAW context.
# By performing those operations in these threads we can get around the invalid CONTEXT error within a draw event.
# This is fairly abusive to the system and may result in instability of operation.
# Then again as long as you trap for stale data it just might work..?
# For best result keep the sleep time as quick as possible...no long delays here.
