Basic Usage:

1.  Enable the addon and expand its display.
2.  Click "Create Baseline" ( You will only need to do this once. )
3.  With some some preference settings having been changed, click "Output Current Configuration".  Settings that are different from their default value are written to a file.  
4.  Now you can load those settings when you like, by clicking the associated button, or by using the Baseline:Configs Menu, which is located on Blender's File Menu.
5.  If the box marked "and_the_keys" is checked, associated hotkeys will also be loaded with the config, if any.


Tips for better usage:

* To make a set of preferences, start from scratch ( factory settings )  and make only the few changes that you would like to group into a set.  Changes can include enablement of addons and also hotkeys, along with the setting of preferences.  After you have everything set up, output that configuration and exit blender.  Saved configurations can be loaded using the File > Baseline:Configs menu.

*  Preference sets are saved as a pair of files:  one for the settings and the addons, and one for the hotkeys.   They can be found in the scripts/datafiles folder.
