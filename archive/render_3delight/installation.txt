3Delight/Blender Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------

Unpack and move the render_3delight folder into your blender addons folder. You can then enable the addon in the Addons tab of blender user preferences


You may also need to tell blender the location of your 3Delight installation folder. When you start Blender and the add-on, it will try to guess where your 3Delight folder is, but it may not be correct. You can set this folder explicitly in the Blender Property Editor:
Render Properties -> Search Paths panel -> 3Delight Path

Setting the location in Blender is enough to make it work, however if you want to avoid setting it manually each time, you can force it by editing the 3delight_env.txt file in the render_3delight add-on folder. Simply add the path to the 3Delight installation folder at the end of the first line and save the file. For example:
DELIGHT=/Applications/Graphics/3Delight-9.0.84

The location specified in 3delight_env.txt will override anything set in the Render Properties -> 3Delight Path property.

Finally, if you have 3Delight's environment variables set ($DELIGHT, $DL_SHADERS_PATH, etc), these paths will override both the 3Delight Path property and the 3delight_env.txt file.
