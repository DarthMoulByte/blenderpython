My collection of Blender Addons

installation 
============

Download the zip file & unpack.
Copy the scripts folder & paste over the Blender scripts directory on your os.
This will replace addons_utils.py in modules to activate the addons extern folder.

Addons Extern Folder
====================

The addons_extern folder contains many working addons I've collected over the years.
Currently the addons_extern is reasonably up to date for blender 2.75.
However, I cannot guarentee every addon will be up to date at any given time.
Please check original authors site/s for updates.
The flip side of this is there's many addons here that are not working elsewhere...

Note: addons_extern is a very useful folder, once set up, you can drop any addon in there & it's recognized.
This allows you to delete any scripts you don't need & repopulate with ones you like at any time.
The added benifit of this is there's no need to mix in your favorite external addons into blenders addons folders, 
then have to find & replace for each new Blender version, 
simply update the addons_utils.py to activete addons extern folder & paste it into new blender scripts directory & your favorites are right there.

Enjoy.
